# Back-End-Bizz
I created the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code provided by the University of Washington's Fullstack Coding Bootcamp. I set up an Express.js API that uses Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Description
As a manager of an internet retail company, I will be able to use this back end for my e-commerce website, which will compete with other growing brands by utilizing cutting-edge technologies to showcase products that I am selling.
